# Git Repository Status Checker

`check_git_status` is a versatile Bash script designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the status of multiple Git repositories within a specified directory. It presents the status of each repository in a neatly formatted table and provides a summary of repository states at the end. The script supports various features such as filtering, help options, and autocompletion to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Git Status Overview**: The script inspects each Git repository within a target directory and categorizes them as `Clean`, `Dirty`, or `Stagging` based on their current state.
- **Flexible Filtering**: Use the `-f` option to filter repositories by status (`Clean`, `Dirty`, or `Stagging`), showing only the repositories of interest.
- **Detailed Help Option**: Provides a `-h` or `--help` option to display detailed usage instructions, examples, and available options.
- **Formatted Tabular Output**: Outputs results in a clear, readable table format, making it easy to see the status of multiple repositories at a glance.
- **Status Summary**: At the end of the output, the script provides a summary count of repositories by their status.
- **Bash Autocompletion**: Supports autocompletion for options and commands, simplifying usage. Autocompletion is installed automatically when the script is run for the first time.

## Installation

To install the `check_git_status` script, follow these steps. Make sure to run these commands with `sudo` to ensure proper installation:

### Step 1: Install `check_git_status`

Run the following command to download and install the script directly from the repository:

```bash
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnofresno/scripting-tools/master/repos-status-checker/check_git_status -o /usr/local/bin/check_git_status && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check_git_status
```

This command will download the script and place it in `/usr/local/bin/check_git_status`, making it available system-wide. The first time you run the script, it will also install the autocompletion if it is not already installed.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the script to check the status of Git repositories in a specific directory. By default, it will check the current directory if no target directory is provided.

### Basic Command

```bash
check_git_status /path/to/target/directory
```

If no directory is specified, the script will default to the current directory (`.`).

### Options

- `-f [Dirty|Stagging|Clean]`: Filter the output to display only repositories with the specified status.
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information, usage instructions, and examples.

### Examples

1. **Check the status of all repositories in a directory:**

    ```bash
    check_git_status /path/to/target/directory
    ```

2. **Show only repositories with unstaged changes (Dirty):**

    ```bash
    check_git_status /path/to/target/directory -f Dirty
    ```

3. **Display help message:**

    ```bash
    check_git_status -h
    ```

## Autocompletion

The script supports Bash autocompletion for options such as `-f Dirty`, `-f Stagging`, `-f Clean`, `-h`, and `--help`. This makes it easier to use by providing suggestions as you type.

### Manually Reload Autocompletion

If you need to manually reload the autocompletion scripts after the installation, use the following command:

```bash
source /etc/bash_completion.d/check_git_status_autocomplete.sh
```

## Output Format

The script outputs a table with the following columns:

- **Repository**: The name of the Git repository.
- **Status**: The status of the repository:
  - `Clean`: No changes detected.
  - `Dirty`: Unstaged changes are present.
  - `Stagging`: Changes are staged for commit.
- **Changes #**: The number of changes detected in the repository.
- **Last Commit Author Email**: The email of the author of the last commit, if available.

A summary table is displayed at the end, providing a quick overview of the number of repositories in each status.

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of what the output looks like:

```
+----------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------------------------+
| Repository                 | Status         | Changes # | Last Commit Author Email   |
+----------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------------------------+
| repo1                      | Clean          | 0         |                            |
| repo2                      | Dirty          | 3         | user@example.com           |
| repo3                      | Stagging       | 2         | anotheruser@example.com    |
+----------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------------------------+

Summary:
+-----------+-------+
| Status    | Count |
+-----------+-------+
| Clean     |     1 |
| Dirty     |     1 |
| Stagging  |     1 |

```
